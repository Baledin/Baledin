### Hi there, my name is Jeremy and I love to code. 

I'm currently working with Unity (C#) and Python3 as my primary languages but have a wide range of experience with other languages, including Visual Basic, PHP, and React. I'm also a dad to two lovely children and enjoy coaching soccer, sailing, and playing games (board, card, dice, video games).

#### Fun facts
- I currently work at the Washington State Library division of the Office of the Secretary of State as a senior graphic designer
- I run my own web development business - jiveconsulting.com
- Iâ€™m currently learning character modeling with Blender
- I was married in a castle
- I once left a date sitting on my couch on New Years Eve because a new coding project was in my head and I had to at least get it going (she knew me well enough that this wasn't an unexpected occurance--we DID get out before midnight)

Want to get a hold of me? baledin [@] gmail.com
